The steps to launch the local demo:

- launch the metisse server (launch_metisse_server_fvwm.sh) (on the first execution)
- launch one or more slaves (local_slave.sh)
- execute local_master.sh (runs the zvtm server and wait for incoming connections from zvtm-metisse clients)
- launch a zvtm-metisse client to interact with the x server and to share windows on the wall

To launch the wall-demo:

- launch the metisse server (launch_metisse_server_fvwm.sh) (on the first execution)
- launch "cluster_run.sh -n intothewild" (but you must check that the path in the file is the path where the slave app is installed on each machine of the cluster
- execute launch_master.sh (runs the zvtm server and wait for incoming connections from zvtm-metisse clients)
- launch zvtm-metisse clients
