The steps to launch the local demo:

- launch the metisse server (launch_metisse_server_fvwm.sh) (on the first execution)
- launch one or more slaves (local_slave.sh)
- execute local_master.sh (will run the zvtm compositor communicating with the metisse server)

To launch the wall-demo:

- launch the metisse server (launch_metisse_server_fvwm.sh) (on the first execution)
- launch the cluster_run.sh (but you must update the inner path where the slave app is installed
- execute launch_master.sh (will run the zvtm compositor communicating with the metisse server)
