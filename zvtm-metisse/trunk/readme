The steps to launch the local demo:

- launch the metisse server (launch_metisse_server_fvwm.sh)
- execute launch_master.sh (will run a zvtm server on local host)
- execute launch_client.sh (will connect a client compositer to the server)
	note: the ip address in argument of ClientMain must be the server address 

to make the zvtm menu on the client appear, scroll the wheel up, down and up or down, up and down
