=================
A few quick notes
=================

When executing a program based on zvtm-cluster, do put the
zvtm-cluster jar file in your classpath, *not* the vanilla zvtm 
jar.

Building: zvtm-cluster is built using maven2 (2.2.0+ recommended). 
To compile and package the sources, execute:
  $ mvn package

Dependencies:
zvtm-cluster depends on
  zvtm
  aspectJ
  jgroups
  args4j 
  slf4j

It is possible to generate a jar file containing the library and its dependencies: 
  $ mvn assembly:assembly
