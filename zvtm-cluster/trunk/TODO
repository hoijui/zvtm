List of issues and improvements needed in zvtm-cluster,
in no particular order (yet)

* Better static safety for ObjId (being adressed now)
* Slave Objects: option to disallow nulls (throw exception, fail
assertion... ?)
* Better role description and interface for SlaveUpdater!!
* Code organization for aspects
* Some factoring can be done in the generic AutoReplay proxy
* Support for background color in ClusteredViews
* Support for portals (throw away portal branch)
* VirtualSpace#removeAllGlyphs support
