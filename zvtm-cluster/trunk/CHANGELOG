Moved some common operations from AutoReplay to static Deltas in GlyphReplication.
This is meant to increase performance, especially where animations are concerned.

Added z-index replication at glyph construction (in addition to the already
existing onTop... support)

Notice: starting with 0.2.5-SNAPSHOT, zvtm-cluster requires zvtm-core 0.11.0

0.2.4

Changed coordinates system to match the new zvtm coordinate system (0.11.0+).
The new system uses double precision floating point coordinates.
Added Composite support (requires a recent zvtm trunk checkout). Adding support
for Composite glyph required a fairly large rework of the GlyphCreation aspect.
Some things may break.
Added VSlice.setAngle to AutoReplay methods
Added Glyph.stickToGlyph to AutoReplay methods

0.2.3 

Added VirtualSpace.show and VirtualSpace.hide to Autoreplay methods.
Added DPath.edit to Autoreplay methods.
Added local_slave and local_master example scripts
Added serialization of raw images (i.e. VImage in complement to the already-existing
ClusteredImage class)

0.2.2

Added graceful shutdown capabilities 
Moved back to JGroups 2.7.0.GA due to a bug / puzzling behavior in JGroups 2.8.0.

0.2.0

Moved to JGroups 2.8.0GA, mainly because it figures out which network interface
and protocol to use in a smarter way.
